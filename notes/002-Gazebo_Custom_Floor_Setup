1) Crtl + H to visualize hidden folers at /home/vincent/

2) Assume your materials called vc_game_field
$mkdir ~/.gazebo/models/vc_game_field
$mkdir -p ~/.gazebo/models/vc_game_field/materials/textures 
$mkdir -p ~/.gazebo/models/vc_game_field/materials/scripts

3) Create a vc_game_field.material
Be careful about line 1 and line 11, the names should match with other files.

4) Put vc_game_field.material into ~/.gazebo/models/vc_game_field/materials/scripts

5) Put the image(map) you want into ~/.gazebo/models/vc_game_field/materials/textures

6) Create model.sdf in ~/.gazebo/models/vc_game_field
Be careful about line 3,32,33,34, the names should match with other files. Especially line 34, it should be match with vc_game_field.material line 1.

7) Create model.config in ~/.gazebo/models/vc_game_field
Be careful about line 3&6, the name will be displayed in gazebo gui.

8) Launch gazebo and you should able to see your own materials
$ roslaunch robot_gazebo simulation.launch

9) If you want to adjust the size of the map, you can go to model.sdf and look for <size> a  b</size>

a: red axis
b: green axis
